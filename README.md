#### Objective
    Connect to Client and recieve multiple matrix search problems. Solve and return the solution.
### Program's Capabilities
  Can solve complex matrix problems using algorithims such as DFS, BestFS and Astar.The program will store old solutions in a cache manager in order to recall it if needed again inorder to save time.
### All You Need To Know To Run Program
    1)Open terminal at file location.
    2)Copy following command in terminal : g++ -std=c++14 *.cpp -Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Wnon-virtual-dtor -pedantic -o a.out -pthread
    3)All files required are in the main folder.
### One More Thing
   In the main.cpp file you can choose which algorithim to run. We have BestFS running while the other three are in a comment. To switch, just remove the one you want from the omment and put the last one back into a comment. In order to run AStar you will also need to go into OA.cpp and and put line 84 in a comment and remove line 83 from the comment.
